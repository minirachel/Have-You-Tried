    Have You Tried is a generator of unsolicited advice.<br>Yes, by loading this page and pressing the button...<br> it is "solicited".<br>But is it any more helpful?<br> Per usual, the details of your troubles are irrelevant. <br>
    <br>

    During difficult times, "Have You Tried" can be used as a supplement to / replacement for:
    <ul>
        <li>misguided but loving family members</li>
        <li>coworkers who are somehow well adjusted</li>
        <li>facebook friends trapped in a MLM scheme</li> 
        <li>a best friend who is tired of this conversation</li>
        <li>random dude on twitter</li>
    </ul>

It is urgent for you to follow the suggested action <br>even if you have definitely already tried it.<br><br>
Limit usage to twice a day <br>or whenever you just felt like venting.
